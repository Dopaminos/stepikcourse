that's some tasks i'm doing from https://stepik.org/course/220674/ to learn golang, right now i completed 63% (153/224 lessions)

that's not all of them because i'm mostly doing it at work and i can't reach that pc to get all pieces of code

todo: finish course, more advanced main.go with sublists, 

## rewrite stuff to make it work properly cuz rn im just copypasting from stepik
